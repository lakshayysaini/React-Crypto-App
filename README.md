This is basically a react app with modern UI/UX made with the help of Redux Toolkit, UI Creation using Ant Design, creating charts using Chart.js, and fetching data from multiple sources using RapidAPI

So, you can download the zip file or fork the repository

1. Run "npm install" to install all the necessary dependencies
2. Run "npm start" to start the app in your local machine

Just make sure to subscribe the coinranking API and test the endpoints because from there you'll receive your unique API key.

Thanks :)
